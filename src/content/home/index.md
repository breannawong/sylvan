    We draw inspiration from forests: places of stillness and light, where
    beauty reveals itself slowly and without spectacle.


    We approach every wedding with patience and a filmmaker’s eye, crafting
    films that don’t just show what happened, but preserve how it felt.

    Want to be present on their day, not performing it.


    Are drawn to quiet moments, to real laughter, and to the way a hand rests in
    another hand when no one else is watching.


    If you’re hoping to remember your wedding not just as something that
    happened, but as something you truly lived, you’re in the right place.

    Sylvan is led by filmmaker Dustin Stuppy, based in Pittsburgh.


    For more than a decade, I’ve filmed weddings and real moments with an
    unobtrusive, observant approach, letting people be themselves and allowing
    stories to unfold naturally.


    My goal is never to direct your day, but to preserve it with honesty and
    care.

    Before anything is booked, we meet to talk about who you are, how your day
    will unfold, and what matters most to you.


    As your date approaches, we reconnect to walk through the details: the
    venue, the flow of the day, the people who matter most.


    On the day itself, our presence is quiet and observant. We work with natural
    light, real sound, and genuine interactions, allowing the story of your day
    to unfold without interruption.


    After your wedding, your film is shaped thoughtfully, weaving together
    images, voices, and ambient sound into something that feels less like a
    video and more like a place you can return to.


    Your film is delivered in the weeks that follow.

    If you’re planning a wedding and feel drawn to a quieter, more intentional
    way of remembering it, we’d love to hear about what you’re envisioning.


    Share your date, location, and anything you’d like us to know and we’ll be
    in touch to start the conversation.
